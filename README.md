I keep stuff here, explore. :)

NOTE: I am using my version of the InMoov head and not the default V1 or V2 head. 
- Gestures will still be compatible as I have my services set up to do so.
- The main differences with my head is it has a ```Lateral Jaw```.
- ```Lateral Jaw``` will be assigned to ```i01.head.upperLip``` V2 Head servo service.
